# DATA-MOE
This repository contains an ongoing project focused on understanding and improving the mapping decisions of the routing layer to different experts in a Mixture of Experts (MoE) model. Our primary objective is to uncover latent clusters within the dataset based on these expert mappings, and to explore various strategies for stabilizing training and optimizing model performance.
