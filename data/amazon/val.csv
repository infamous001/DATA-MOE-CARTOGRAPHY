Pathetic design of the caps. Very impractical to use everyday. The caps close so tight that everyday we have to wrestle with the bottle to open the cap.

Literally just got this an hour ago. Bought it because my friend needs a headset and honestly so do I. I didnt wamt to pay for two high priced headsets so I took a look at cheap ones. Main thing I liked about this is the splitter jack. Years ago I had bought myself some headphones made by afterglow that came with a audio splitter. It was my favorite headset. Not only could you hear the gameplay and voice chat but you could also hear the music you played from your phone or other device. I got this in hopes of finding a cheap headset me and my friend could both have and also because I wanted that same audio splitter. Yes I could have bought a pricey headset with a splitter but like I said. I was shopping for a friend too so I didnt want to spend a whole lot. The reviews on this were good so I said lets do it. The product got to my door and I was excited. I unboxed the headset, read the instructions and configuration booklet and plugged it in. First thing I noticed. A sharp screeching noise when you try to turn up or down on the volume control. I had to set it to mid volume in order to not hear screeching but the gameplay audio was very low and there was a little bit of static in the background. I started a party chat to test if my whole party could hear the audio through my headset( have to check because cheap headset have an issue with your friends being able to hear what you are playing even when your tv volume is turned all the way down) and nothing. So I thought alright cool lets try talking. I spoke and no audio was transmitted to my party. I ended up having to twist and push in the headsets jack in order to use the mic ( yes I had it plugged in correctly) and when I spoke I could hear myself as well. That was with just the headsets jack in. The splitter does not work at all. Well not completely. The screeching issue when adjusting the volume was gone but all you can hear is the music you plugged in. Nothing else. You cant even talk to your friends anymore because the microphone is just simply unfixable no matter what you do. If you are going to get a headset put in the effort and money to buying a good quality headset. In the end you save more money.",0,0,68,1000068

Recent purchase is a cheap look-a-like. I purchased this chair in 2017 and like it so much that i asked my family to buy a 2nd one for me as a birthday gift this year. I sent my family the link from my order 2 years ago and they purchased it for me. But what arrived is not the same chair at all. I don't think there is a single part on the chair that is the same as the one from 2017. The brackets are thinner. The bolts are silver (as opposed to the brown ones previously that matched). The holes for the bolts don't line up causing the new chair to be crooked and putting pressure on the bolts. The cushions are smaller and more square (cheaper looking). The arms, legs, rockers, backrest, and seat are thinner. The vinyl is wrapped looser. The reinforcement under the seat has fewer straps to hold up the seat. Bait And Switch. The product has changed substantially and the company is taking advantage of years of good reviews but delivering a different product. Bait And Switch. Ive reported this to Amazon. As of today, the 5 pics at the top of the listing are of the chair i received 2 years ago. However, lower in the detailed From The Manufacturer section, the more current chair is pictured.

The mouth is terribly small as well and doesn't feel like it's in the proper position. The only good thing about this mask is the material - It's pretty hefty and seems like it would keep me warm, but I can't outlook the issue with the eyes and mouth.

Do not read the old reviews that rave this product. The quality is not what it used to be. I asked for a pair of these for Christmas a couple years ago. I have always had trouble with earbuds staying in my ears, so I thought I'd give these a try after reading the reviews. When I got them, I was pleasantly surprised with how easily and comfortably they fit. Then I plugged them in. I was immediately impressed with the sound quality. I used them all the time, working out at the gym, on long plane rides, and just sitting around and relaxing. Through some normal wear and tear, the wires split and stripped a little. Once that happened, the sound cut in and out. Since I loved these earbuds so much, I decided to buy another pair. They just arrived an hour ago. I am extremely disappointed, to say the least. The first thing I noticed out of the box is that the main wire is thinner, and much more flimsy feeling, than it used to be. Though, it is about a half inch longer. My first thought was wondering how long it would take for this pair to split with such flimsy design. Then I plugged it into my phone, which is where I listen to most of my music. I could immediately hear a downgrade in sound, which was so disappointing to me. I took my old pair and plugged them in just to make sure I wasn't imagining it. The old ones still sounded great!! My first experience with these earbuds was so amazing. That's why I had no problem spending $75 to get another pair. If I had known I'd be getting an inferior product, I never would have added these to my shopping cart. Poor sound, poor design. I have added a couple pictures. In one of the pictures, you can see my old pair with 3 splits and exposed wire. In the other, you can see the comparison to the new and old.

Do not buy these, spend a little more money and buy QD swivels from reputable companies like Magpul, BCM, Midwest Industries etc. One swivel works fine and the other one is full of problems. The button is mushy and gets stuck in the depressed position. I sprayed some liquid graphite in it and was able to get it to unlatch. However it won't stay in a QD socket at all, the smallest amount of force will cause it to pop out of the socket, which is very dangerous. Had it pop out of the QD socket twice at the range and nearly dropped my rifle both times but luckily caught it. Only buy these if your going to put it on a cheap rifle that you're not afraid to have potentially dropped, which kind of goes against the whole reason of having a sling in the first place.

The corks don’t stay in, you do have to push them in pretty far in order to stay, HOWEVER, doing so, you won’t be able to remove them anymore. I tried to remove one and the cork ended up breaking into pieces. The glasses are EXTREMELY fragile. I dropped one that was broken at the top, into the trash and it shattered into a million pieces. Definitely putting a sign in front of these for the baby shower that says fragile. Also, needed to buy little baggies to put them in, that way if they do break during the baby shower, it’s within each baggy.

I absolutely love how minimal this case is. I have tried three different cases for the Pixel 3xl and this one is my favorite. The only small changes I would like to see is an ever-so-slightly higher raised edge to help protect the front screen and a more beveled fingerprint circle to allow a more seamless scan of the fingers. Definitely the case for those that want their phone to look like it doesn't have a case (if the phone is black). Mine did crack while trying to take it off the phone once, but ESR quickly replaced it free of charge within a few days. Update: Got a replacement case from ESR and this one also cracked within a couple months (no drops). The crack appeared in the same place as the previous one.

With all the other toys and legos kids play with, there are so many small pieces, it's important to provide good storage for kids as they clean up and sort toys in their play areas. This is not good storage. The plastic box was smashed during shipping because it is made of thin material and I'm sure the handle wouldn't last long.

Bought as an under belt for duty gun belt. It has one finished (or cut, trimmed) end. And one chopped off, unfinished , sharp cut and not rounded off end.

The only full length side is the soft side of the Velcro. More than likely, I’m going to take this strap of leather, to a TAC store, and have hard side Velcro sewn onto it, and have it “finished” by them, or just return it and go buy a belt in person from the 5.11 Store.

en_0432287,"Disappointing

I have several issues with this endoscope that caused me to return it: 1) There are two laws of civil engineering: F=MA and ""You can't push on a rope."" This device violates rule #2. It isn't nearly rigid enough. I wanted to look above my ceiling to trace the electrical wiring, but I couldn't snake this thing more than about four feet before it started to bend and bunch up. Trying to negotiate it through any sort of rough terrain is maddening when you can't see well and you have no control over the tip. All you can do is push on that rope. Why have a 10 meter scope if you can't use more than four feet of it? You might be able to run it down some kind of conduit or pipe or reinforce the cable with wire to stiffen it, but I don't feel like that should be necessary. 2) Thinking maybe I was using this for the wrong purpose, I tried running it down a drain pipe. I couldn't negotiate the P trap and the camera got covered with gunk so quickly that it wouldn't have mattered if I could. I think the best use for this is to look under your refrigerator or maybe in your gutter downspout. 3) The camera needs some kind of self-leveling mechanism. It's impossible to keep the cable from rotating as you try to maneuver it. You can tell the app to rotate the image 90 degrees at a time, but you can't tell the scope to stay right side up. You're constantly trying to figure out which way is up and what you're looking at. 4) When you add attachments, they block the view of the camera. It's like walking around using only your peripheral vision. It works, but not well. With much effort I successfully retrieved my keys using the magnet and the hook when they were on the floor right in front of me, so there's some theoretical value there. The mirror attachment is simply unusable -- I already said it was hard to use, once you can't see what's in front of you it's impossible. 5) The ""magic claw"" isn't attached to the device at all. It's a completely separate tool, and not very good. Search Amazon for ""flexible grabber"" and you'll see what it is, except it's only 2 feet long including the handle. Worthless. 6) You have to disconnect from your normal WiFi network in order to connect to this device. Not a deal killer, but inconvenient. There are a few things I liked about this device: 1) It's fairly inexpensive 2) The camera is decent 3) The light is good unless it gets covered in gunk 4) I found it fairly easy to connect",1,1,1541,1001541

en_0082224,"Battery Life is less than advertised

I ordered this recently and I thought I should give a balanced review. First, the product is cleverly designed and extends the practical life of older Bose headphones by making them Bluetooth enabled. Certainly they can be used in a wired mode, but that has become less and less convenient. The product fits well and is unobtrusive. It sounds fine. It can be charged without removing it and this is its biggest selling point over competitors. In the material, it says ""Built-in long lasting battery, charging 2 hours for enjoying up to 15 hrs music playtime or talk."" so I thought the battery would be fine. It actually only lasts between 3 and 4 hours. I contacted the seller and they responded: ""Hello, Thanks for your message, this adapter's battery life is about 5 hours, so it is normal to be that. And if the music is louder, the battery power will be lost more fast. Thank you "" So I was disappointed. If battery life is a priority for you, keep this in mind.",1,1,1573,1001573

Bought this product as a replacement to the factory screen protector. From the start there were issues, even though some were minor I might as well list all of them. 1. Box has the instructions but they had a giant product sticker covering all of it. I didn't need the insturctions, but this could be difficult for other people who might not know how to. 2. The edges are not smooth and beveled so mine already cracked with less than 2 weeks of use. I have normal items in my pocket such as keys my phone. 3. Case made a slight sticky noise when typing or using the phone, I just drowned out the sound eventually. 4. Glass seems to be a fingerprint magnet. Just after the application of the new screen I noticed how all the touches appeared on the screen. Overall. I will use the second one since I got two, don't want to waste money.

The adhesive at the edge is the only adhesive, too. Which leaves the cover with gaps- now touch points are inaccurate. Typing on a touch screen is hard enough, now I have to ""push"" hard to record taps. All of the cutouts are in the edge as well, not surrounding the home button, camera, etc. And the fit isn't good around them either. Does it work? Yes, it protects the screen.

This product has problems; when you try to assemble it you quickly realize some of the drill holes (especially on the top shelf) are too close together by approximately 1/8 inch. The only way you can assemble this product is to forcibly bend the heavy duty wire retaining pieces until they slide into the drill holes. Even then, ""slide"" is not the correct word because you have to beat them into place with a rubber mallet: Assuming you are strong enough to do this, once beaten into place the bent- wire retainer pieces will try to spring open; this runs the permanent risk of splitting the wooden shelf into two or more pieces.

This pillow did not give the correct alignment for my cervical vertebra to be curved properly.

I’ve tried several brands of reusable pads/rounds and these not only didn’t wash clean (I don’t use foundation or waterproof products either), but the non-exfoliating (blue ring) pads are practically resistant to any of my toners.

I recommend reusable clothes of all kinds and have been using them for two/three years now but these aren’t functional for most skincare.

en_0211941,"Perfect fit for 2016 RAV4, but very expensive and needs grip in trunk area

These floor mats fit my 2016 RAV4 like they were built by Toyota. The material is durable and the lips around the edges allow them to collect dirt and debris. The only flaw I found was the texture on the trunk mat. I was hoping for something that had a little more friction. As is, my groceries slide all over the place on the slick surface. This would be a good thing if you have something heavy, say a big tent, cooler full of ice and drinks, and large luggage that you want to set on the edge and slide to the back of the vehicle. In that case, you don't want sticky friction making it more difficult. That is a rare case for me, as I am more likely to throw a cart full of groceries back there. That type of texture would have made it difficult to clean too, which I can appreciate. I like the texture on the rest of the floor mats where it makes sense. It is enough of a problem for me that I removed a star. I also removed a star because they are extremely expensive! I would have liked to see them more around $150 - $175. But I still bought them, and I do HOPE they last for the life of the vehicle, in which case, it is a worthy investment. If I have to replace them in 5 years, the cost would then be unreasonable. Overall, I highly recommend these floor mats to anyone looking to protect their 2016 RAV4 floors. They are very expensive and things in the trunk do slide around too much, but you won't find a better fit or better protection I think. 3/5 stars.

I'd like to say ""wow, love these"" but I can't. It wouldn't take much to turn these into great bibs and I would have paid a bit more to get it. These are better than most $40 bibs, yes, and they are a lot worse than $180 bibs. I'd have rather paid a little more to get a couple minor improvements and then the difference between these and $180 bibs would have been far less and this would be a 5 star review. So where's the area for improvements: 1) In this price range a gel chamois is expected or at least something approximating that sort of density. Sadly I didn't see that in the description it says ""foam"" padding. That's just lame. It really doesn't do much of anything padding wise. 2) While I'm sure it helps from a coolness factor, the bib straps are just too flimsy a material. It isn't the same as the rest of the shorts so it really doesn't pull the shorts up and keep them in position. Better than a drawstring at the waist but just not as functional as a bib should be. If you want bibs that would be great for relatively short rides (padding not so important) in hot weather, these would be ok, but they really aren't up there for more substantial rides.",2,2,2312,1002312

The only benefit is the medicine i think goes all the way to the edge so its slightly easier getting the smaller patches to fit over larger pimples, where as the other brand the medicine was in the middle and sometimes Id not get the patch quite centered. The sheets are not perforated so you have to carful pull the patch off with your fingernails and hope you dont mess up the edge. These patches work pretty much like the other brand I bought before. Some times they work over night, sometimes i have to use multiple patches back to back and sometimes they don't work at all, mostly on the deep pimples.

These appear quite powerful for their small size, they shoot out a visibly large amount of steam.

Compared to a real humidifier, if you place your hand above the steam, your hand will get wet, meaning it’s actually putting out much more water than these things. You’d probably have to have these running for a few hours to elevate humidity compared to a good humidifier running for 30 minutes. For a diffuser they’re perfect, as a humidifier a solid NEGATIVE! I have an electronic RH (relative humidity) meter, and these barely raised the RH by less than 5%. I only bought these to help my tropical plants in summer, and even then, humidity never went past 45%. But since I live in the California desert, I will take any humidity increase I can.

Saw a Couple of reviews about this one so I figured I would put my Two cents in. One thing that's great is that it holds a lot of cards without bending them as long as you don't try to move the book around in weird ways and what not. But that's about all this does. The book itself just looks like they took 2 x 20 page monster binders and then slapped them together into one binding, so overall its not really great for people who like to admire their cards frequently. Also, the outside material doesn't seem to be as tough as their other binders that are smaller, I wonder if this is because of the stress of having a larger capacity for cards or what, but the material on my particular binder is already starting to tear apart, but like I said, the cards are in good shape and are protected so I guess this binder is technically doing it's job haha. This Binder overall is great for people who buy/sell/trade a lot of their bulk and need something with a large capacity to carry all of their extra cards around, but if you want something that you can admire your cards in, just get the regular 20 page monster binders.",2,2,2519,1002519

en_0542338,"A movie that does many things right, but is not worth watching.

This movie is good. It is not great, but it covers a lot of bases. The directing is excellent, with camera work and scene structure that builds to a worthy end. The acting is great, with Renee Russo and Jake Gyllenhaal remaining captivating throughout. Gyllenhaal's character deeply flawed protagonist is excellent as it delicately balances multiple deep character flaws that leave you uncertain and curious to know what happens next. But the story is... unsatisfying. Anticlimactic. Poor. And far worse. Without spoilers I will do the best I can. Jake Gyllenhaal portrays a character who has no character arc, that is not the point of this movie. He starts off desperate and hungry for success, and he ends the same way. We only see the slightest suggestions of him becoming more successful, and we see how far he will go for that success - but this is not new, as we see him go just as far in the opening minutes of the film. Though I imagine everyone is expecting the movie and plot to go in a certain direction (because it is an absurdly cliche story that you have seen before in TV shows, other movies, and books), the movie ends up aiming slightly lower to avoid being entirely cliche. I am certain that at some point the writer/director realized that this was just another retelling of an old trope, and tried to edit the ending to make it a tad less obvious. It does not benefit the movie. Taking a trope and making it weaker does not make a strong movie, it makes a forgettable movie. That is what this movie is - incredibly forgettable. But that is not all that is wrong with the writing in this film. Gyllenhaal's character is clearly autistic (and the writer/director has confirmed this is intentional) to the point that this comes off as a hit piece about people with autism. I have worked with people on the spectrum and while Gyllenhaal's portrayal of an autistic protagonist is well done, the writing behind it disastrously misunderstands what autism is. While the writing has Gyllenhaal correctly neglecting enormous social cues, it also portrays him as obscenely manipulative, exercising such enormous control over social situations that it is absurd. To be frank, regardless of how high functioning Jake Gyllenhaal's character is supposed to be, he cannot both be autistic and simultaneously be so ridiculously successfully manipulative in social situations. This movie makes autistic people out to be self centered villains who will stop at absolutely nothing to obtain what they want. It is a disgustingly misinformed examination of autism. At this point you may be wondering why this movie has such high reviews. While it may be due to Jake Gyllenhaal's convincing glass eyed smiles or Renee Russo's believable portrayal of a struggling exec, I think it also has to do with a less impressive aspect of the film. This movie aims for low hanging fruit, criticizing the news media for being exploitative and corrupt. Literally all of America (and much of the world) has an issue with this right now, the only difference from person to person being exactly which stations they think are worse. I am not saying the media does not deserve this criticism (it really does), and the movie does an excellent job at portraying how ratings come before morality - I am just saying that this is the modern equivalent of making an 80's scifi movie where the military and government are the villains. But that is it. A huge cliche aimed at an easy target. A disgustingly inaccurate portrayal of a person with autism. A well directed movie with a very low goal that completely succeeds at what it is trying to do, but will be forgotten by the next day.",2,2,2660,1002660

I've used this about 6 or 7 times and when its on right, it does the job. But the velcro sticking to itself and the straps tangling and adjusting the backstrap up or down is frustrating. Not good for customer satisfaction. I think longer straps would help a lot, but that could be a problem in public under a shirt. However, they could give that option or design a detatchable strap extension. And the people they use to model it are young, slim, and athletic. How realistic is that.! That's not their customer base. I'm 85 years old, 6 feet and 190 pounds. If they'd create a clear, detailed video tutorial it would pay them huge profits with positive reviews. ONE DAY LATER AND I'M EDITING THIS.... I added extensions to both straps and its so much better! As I said above, it does the job once its on right. I poked two tiny holes near the end of each strap and ran a thin, strong, plastic covered wire through to make a loop about 8 inches long. Problem solved!

Basically, you need to let one of these earphones (doesn't matter which one) pair to the other BEFORE pairing either with device. If you pair with your device first, both of them will show up and you end up having an either/or situation instead of both. So once they're paired with each other, only pair ONE of your earbuds to the phone and VOILA, you have music in both ears!

There was only ONE time out of the 3 that I was actually able to put air into it and it was awesome!!! Other than that, it was not. It was too much work to put air into that I had to make it some kind of a game. I mean, there's just too big of a hole to close off when air is being put into the hammock. I can't say it can hold 440 pounds either. I think it was more like 200 pounds at the most. Any more than that, it will start to flatten. When it was inflated perfectly, many of us were able to hang on the sides and float around. Two of us were able to lay on it without drowning. The mesh actually stayed in one piece too. No rip whatsoever. The fastening of the buckle doesn't make sense to me, but if it works then that is all that matters. I just need to get used to the buckling, I guess. I gave this hammock 4 stars because the idea of a hammock that requires swinging around in a circle to put air into it is cool to me. When it is inflated, it is fun. When it is deflated, it is space saving. And when it is being used, it becomes a fun water activity. Just be careful with it though. The nylon and mesh feels thin, but it can still last a while if taken care of correctly and carefully. Thank you!",3,3,3190,1003190

en_0311189,"Most honest review (I believe)

I have to admit when I first got this and tried it, it seemed like it totally didn't work. I even had a hard time getting it into the device. I tried to instantly crimp the portion of the blind that was damaged and it didn't change it. It still looked damaged and bent. I was beginning to think 'what a waste of money.' I went away for a few minutes about to call Home Depot to see if they simply had new blinds in stock. Then I stopped myself and thought I'd better give it at least one last try. This time I held the damaged part in the device at a curve and held it for about 30-40 seconds. When I released it it had made it significantly better this time. Then I did kind of the same thing in three little areas on the same damaged part again to try and clean it up a bit more. I would say that made it better by another 20%. I think the key here is you have to hold the damaged part curved in the device for at least 40 seconds, maybe even pushing your thumb along it, and then kind of focus more on the nuanced parts of the same damage portion to try and clean it up after the first attempt. I would say if you are a patient person and are willing to treat the process as a kind of microscopic surgery to an extent as opposed to a job you can complete instantly then I think you'll appreciate this device. If the blinds are still hanging it's basically a situation of pulling up a chair for a good half hour and getting to work like a craftsman on them. Maybe you can speed up the process as you get good at it but just prepare yourself to treat it as if you were about to carve a small wood sculpture. It is rewarding though once you see them sort of come back to life. To add, this really works best on blinds that have been bent simply at a 90 degree angle rather than those that are actually mangled and bumpy. Like I said with the bumps it really takes a bit of work and nuanced focus to get those looking decent again.",3,3,3245,1003245

I have used this new Bluetooth earbud for a few weeks now, and here are my likes and dislikes. . . LIKES: 1) fits well in my ear and doesn't fall out. Set it and forget it. It only has one button, and if it is set correctly I have no trouble accessing the button (to end or answer a call). 2) Battery seems to last a long time... put it this way...I have not had the battery die on me yet after numerous calls during a day. 3) The charging method is clever. . . just plug in the USB base, and the earbud has a magnet that grabs it out of your hand for a perfect connection every time. You can find in it dark easily! 4) The speaker is very clear and un-distorted....I'd say the best I've ever had. 5) It has a seemingly long range... longer than others I've had. DISLIKES: 1) I do not like the voice. Why not use the old AT&T woman's voice? This woman speaks the commands clearly, but I just don't like it. Sounds like an old girlfriend. 2) When you walk too far from your phone, it doesn't warn you. . . it just disconnects. You have to turn it back on to reconnect. 3) If you don't use it for awhile, it will turn itself off. I guess that is a good thing? I just have never turned them off until I'm done for the day. 4) Occasionally, and always when you are trying to connect a call..... it will just not work correctly. The phone may show you are connected, but the device is not connected and NOT working. I guess it could be my phone.....I am just not sure.

I ordered this to repaint some cabinet doors. They had your typical tongue-and-groove design, making it impossible to paint an even coat without it looking all globby. While I found out the paint I was using was also infuriating other customers (Valspar High Gloss Enamel SUCKS, is NOT ""self-leveling"" or ""easy to clean,"" and chips with the scrape of a thumbnail despite surface prep!) Overall, you have to clean this device quickly in between uses, but for this price point you can seriously knock some extra work and time off of a project that may take days to do the old-fashioned way. It was worth it to me! I will definitely be using it long into the future. Checkout a breakdown of various components below: Anyway, this product was fairly easy to use after perusing the instructions for a bit. While the viscosity cup provided is supposed to help indicate how much to thin your paint, it didn't really work for its intended purpose, as my paint was taking FOREVER to go through the funnel, way beyond any of the indicated times on the instructions. (For example, instructions indicate to add certain amount of water or thinner based on amount of time it takes for the paint to run through the funnel filled to the top). This led to some difficulty in figuring out how much I should dilute my paint, which led to some trial and error. However, most paint cans do have instructions for paint sprayer dilution, so that helped some! >APPLICATION - relatively easy but takes a bit of practice and increasing the velocity of the spray to ensure it is coming out in an even stream and not in splatters, which can also be affected a lot by how much you diluted it. Won't flow correctly if it is too thick. Difficult to do small applications of paint because you have to keep scraping the paint to the bottom of the container for it to be sucked through the straw. >DEVICE ITSELF - turns on easily, but I will say it the motor starts getting pretty hot quickly, which made me a bit nervous to use it for more than a few minutes at a time. Parts are all easy to assemble/reassemble. >CLEANING - While the parts are easy to clean, I frequently wished that I could put it down and come back to it later in between coats. Paint can be left in the reservoir if you seal it well with plastic wrap, but you have to run water through the sprayer otherwise it will get all dried up VERY fast with water-based paint once you turn it off. You 100% NEED a straw-cleaning bristle brush to clean the sprayer channels that don't detach from the device if anything dries up, otherwise globby and half-dried paint starts going through the nozzle and screwing up the spray pattern.",3,3,3361,1003361

Also, the time-adjustment knobs are not too well calibrated perhaps - well the off time seems about right, but the on time is spectacularly off: when I set it for one minute it stayed on for over eight minutes. But when I tweaked it down to thirty seconds, it stayed on for 90 seconds. Not linear, so you may have to fiddle with it to get the desired operation. Mine runs a 1/4 horsepower water pump.",3,3,3382,1003382

After calibrating this extended battery via full 2 cycle discharge and charge I can confidently say it was a great buy. This has fixed one of the few flaws in my v20, now I can comfortably go 2 full days without charging with moderate use with almost 7 hours screen time, while still maintaining fast charging. There are some minor short comings. The case does not offer much in protection as others have mentioned, the bump surrounding the screen is quite small. Also the screen protector will protect at minor scratches at best but not from drop damage as its not a full glass version. The front camera is also exposed. There is the issue with having to remove the case to fully insert the charger. So I'm taking off a star for that. Still highly recommended would buy again.",3,3,3487,1003487

I Really like it, but it’s not quite a love story; it’s very powerful, for something so small, and lightweight. However, the combination of how/where the hose exits the canister, and the size and number of wheels on the bottom, lead to a continual nuisance of tipping over. The plastic lever for switching out attachments is very cheap plastic, and broke as I was unpacking the vacuum. This may be a huge issue for some, but I don’t ever use attachments, so for me, no harm, no foul. The location of the power switch is a bit problematic as well, considering the other switch located in the mirror position on the back of the canister, causes the cord to retract. I’ve done this no less than 500 times. And no, for clarity, I am not a slow learner. That said, I do in fact, love that the vacuum has a retractable cord. I realize it is trivial, but for me, the winding and wrapping of a loose cord is just irritating. Not difficult, irritating. So the fact I don’t have to wind and wrap and wind and wrap, I’ll give it a star back, for the convenience it provides. Overall though, the pros far outweigh the cons.",3,3,3529,1003529

It was in my pocket and I was not ready, but got it out, sparked it and pitty the pit bull backed off. Of course the owner also called it off, so not really a good test, but dog did look a little perturbed when it was noisily sparking. Taught me a lesson: If dogs in area have it 'ON' and in the hand while walking. In the pocket and turned off cost me time, because I was fumbling to get it out. That dog came quick. The alarm is not ear piecing, it's okay, nothing to write home about. It's well made, the price is right, so I'm very happy with it. Would recommend.",3,3,3795,1003795

I got one of these back when they first started gaining popularity. I will say that this is by far the best protection for your ankle. I had a damaged ankle when I started trying out for professional soccer teams and I was wearing one of these the entire time. I ended up getting picked up and was able to play in Sweden. This brace went above and beyond to protect my ankle so I could achieve my dream. My ankle did end up blowing out when I kicked the ball at the same time as another player that came from the side of me, but it was a ticking time bomb anyway and nothing in the world would have prevented that. The only reason I don't give it a 5 star is because it seems like the velcro has changed. Back when I got my first one, the velcro stuck very strong and it would never come loose. I just purchased two new ones and the velcro straps are always coming undone.",3,3,3801,1003801
en_0451353,"Pretty!

I bought two sets of these to fill six empty ear piercings. Overall, I’m happy. They are very pretty, and they match my more expensive white opal jewelry. Packaging: each set comes in its own small plastic bag sealed with an adhesive strip. There was nothing holding the individual pieces in place, but at least the balls were all screwed on. Luckily, there was no scratches on the material. Putting them in: difficult. One of the balls was stuck on and I couldn’t get it to budge at first. I almost considered returning one set but I was able to get t off after about 10 minutes of trying. Putting them in was challenging because I can’t see behind my ear of course. I’ve been wearing them for a couple weeks now, and I am still pleased. I have very sensitive skin, and I’ve experienced no irritation. The balls have not loosened, and the jewels still fit securely in their settings. I originally wanted to get real white gold jewelry, but I’m not sure I’ll need to anytime soon.",3,3,3802,1003802

The best thing about these phones is the Bluetooth stays solidly connected to my Apple Watch. Unlike some other earbuds I’ve tried, these don’t skip at all. I’ve had no issues with the battery life... I’ve never had them run out while I’m using them. Sound quality... not great. The bass response is poor. It’s slightly better if you can keep the buds firmly inserted in your ear canal, but they seem to work their way out of the ear. They don’t fall off, but they back out. I think this is partially due to the small rubber tab that helps retain them to the outer ear. It’s angled slightly inward (toward the head), and this may put a tiny bit of pressure that gradually pulls the buds out as that rubber tab straightens itself.",3,3,3804,1003804

I really like this product for out the lake . We now have six , not saying they are in good shape. NOT but usable until the last 2. They are nice style because I like to have the control.

I have that many as if company the are great to sit and talk with your yeti. They do fade quickly but we we do keep them on the boat and sun kits them. I have to be re sewing them several times. But think now have to pitch they are torn & threaded and beyond repair. And as others say line inner tube Line up before adding air. If I get a years out of 2 I’m happy. Also I hate plastic and fabric cover is so much nicer. To the Company please do more stitching and maybe heavier material closer sewn & if the bottom material was little thicker it last longer. I do like just up grade. We will pay extra for quality to last longer. Going to have to sew my new 2 , Sadly already May just been flaws idk. But those are disappointing. But I continue to order until I find a similar style better quality and husband wold like his little larger. These work ... Pass return time now. An I do like loop on back so you can tie off to the boat if water is high or you don’t want to drift to far. Or get off and don’t have to pull in boat each time.when you go back in the water. But honestly they look well made I thought we put to much air in but we did not. Not our first we are careful Wish they replace. Or go on sales it’s prime day as I was looking for a sale.

The glass carafe is perfect. The handle has a beautiful shape but is a bit hard for my older hand to grasp. The lid is a bit small and has this strange filter suspended near the spout, not sure what it is supposed to do. The kettle wouldn't shut off after the water boils. Was it defective? No just had to get out my college science hat and remember that at our 5,000 foot elevation water boils at 2 degrees less per 1,000 feet of elevation. So when the water boils it is only 202 not 212 degrees f as at sea level, not high enough to trigger the shut off switch. An option would be to set it at 195 degree ""keep warm"" if you need an automatic shut off. That is fairly close to 202 degrees. We have used the kettle at least 2 times daily for 3 months. It is so much better than the old metal kettle on the stove. I doubt you are going to find anything much better or as practical.",3,3,3900,1003900

I am not sure who the target reader is for this book, as there are many who could find something worthwhile in it, but it makes sense that it is in the Contemporary fiction genre. It is true to life and very realistic. The character of Swain becomes more likable as the story moves on. With each chapter, the drama of Swain's recent life, the divorce, and the loss of his daughter all unfold. I felt for him in his losses and in his joys that he feared to embrace for so long. The Jones character seems to simply exist as a foil to Swain's character; he is the jerk of a friend that one just can't let go of.

Disclosure: I was sent this product in exchange for an honest review. Overall, I really like this case/sleeve.

The zipper opens on three sides which allows the case to open completely and lay flat on the table. The inside is cushioned and provides protection for the device. I do love the color though it looks closer to royal than navy blue. One downside for me is that there is no handle or strap with which to carry the case. The case would easily fit inside a backpack or briefcase but would be a bit more cumbersome to carry alone. In addition, the case is a fairly slick material so it can slip out of your hand while carrying. It is waterproof (I tested it by putting a sheet of paper inside and holding it out in the rain; the paper remained dry) and has a roomy zippered pocket on the outside for carrying a mouse or ear buds or other items.

I can still mount the mic which is nice, the mount is just broken in the middle. The case that it comes with is really convenient.

The waterproof compartment at the bottom is excellent, and easily fits my US > 10 size shoes. I'm sure it would make a great use for packing a lunch or picnic items.

Ms. Samuels Young never disappoints. I recieved an email about the e-release for this book. I immediately downloaded it as I make it a point to read all of her books. I read the first page of this book and was immediately hooked. I READ THE ENTIRE BOOK IN FOUR HOURS. This is one of her by far best writes. She pushes to a new extreme of erotic suspense and has done an amazingly great job at it. The sex scenes are steamy and the order of events are not your typical guess what happens next. You will not be disappointed. I would love a part II to this book... Keep them coming Pamela!",4,4,4825,1004825

en_0509381,"Read this now instead of all the reviews!

Firstly, I'm not your average joe when it comes to a car wash. This is the best product I have ever used on my Corvette. I've had corvettes for 6 years now and no product has done to my car what this has. My car is SLIPPERY!!! SMOOTH!!!! LIKE NEVER BEFORE ITS AMAZING! I want to say SLIPPERY again because that's what it does! Do these steps. If your car is stupidly dirty and has been for a long time ***clay bar first*** 1. Start off by wax stripping your car with Meguiars wash+ as a normal car wash expect bucket only method . Do sections at a time (do not let that stuff dry on your car). Water it down and do sections at a time. Please understand that. 2. Use this sealant on your car. Easy on the entire car then buff off after it turns white. Read product directions. You can do it a second time (not necessary) but wait 30 minutes after you buffed first coat. Please wait 6 hours before adding anything else after this. 3. After 6 hours of curing the sealant on paint, use *Car Guys Hybrid Wax Spray*. I bought a gallon, well worth it. Spray your entire car with that while buffing off doing sections at a time. You can do 2 coats for a better result. This stuff will last you months!!! Sealant is once or twice a year. Hybrid spray wax is applied after every car wash. ***Make sure when you wash your car next time to not use wax stripper on it or you'll defeat everything you have done. The wax stripper is a tool used to prep for a new sealant or wax on the car*** Did you read that up there? 4. Also I like to use chemical guys maxi suds grape. Its concentrated and a gallon. Its $18. Buy 2 gallons it will last you 3 years! Use it right, do not exaggerate. *A cap can do 5 gallons of water* Use more If you want. Best car wash shampoo you'll ever use, better then their entire line up as well. 1 galling should last you a year or 2 depending on how you use it and how much. This product is a shampoo that leaves a small amount of wax and a coat of enhanced glossier on your car after every wash. Never wash your car with hard water after you put this stuff on your car or you'll just strip it of your cars surface. *************************************** Do all of this on your car and maintain it that way all the time. You will wish you can thank me. This is the perfect stuff to keep your car looking its vest you wont even want to drive it! Thanks Car Guys, you guys are something else. This product is really a 10/5 stars",4,4,4994,1004994
